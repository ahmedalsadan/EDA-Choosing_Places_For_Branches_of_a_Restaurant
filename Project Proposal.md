# Choosing-Places-For-Branches-of-a-Restaurant

## Goal
The RS company wants to establish a restaurant.
It is looking for a location which has high density.
People generally concern with this project.
Both entries and exits of MTA stations will be considered for determining the suitable places.

## Data Description
The extracted sample of the dataset is taken in the spring season of 2021
(from 2021/3/20 to 2021/6/25).
I predict that the restaurant will be suitable in near merto stations.
The data will be cleaned because of:
-	Duplicate or unnecessary data
-	Inconsistent text and typos
-	Missing data
-	Outliers

## Tools
-	Jupyter Notebook
-	SQLite 
-	SQLAlchemy
-	Pandas
-	Matplotlib
